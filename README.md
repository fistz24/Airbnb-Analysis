Introduction
-------------------

Enclosed in this folder is my analysis done on New York Airbnb Listings dataset.

Scope 
----------------- 
Through this mini project, we'll find out how do all the features in Airbnb actually affect hosts' listing prices.

<details>
    <summary> Questions that will be answered through this analysis include, but not limited to: </summary>
    
    1. How do listing prices change over time? What caused them to change?
    2. What are some of the factors taken by the host when determining listing prices?
    3. Among all the features in Airbnb, which features have the strongest correlations?
    4. How does Airbnb property distribution look like in New York?
    5. Which neighbourhoods have the most superhosts? Do they have higher average prices?
  </details>
  
Further explanation about the project can be found on my Medium account - linked at the bottom of this page
